# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for Mika. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language towards Mika
* Being respectful of Mika's viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism -> No criticism, only positive thoughts üòá
* Focusing on what is best for Mika
* Showing empathy towards Mika

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission (wtf?)
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting. Remeber, anything can be considered offensive in the modern world. üëç I retain my right to get upset.
* Opening issues on behalf of a company that is going to benefit from Mika's hard work

NB. Mika is always right and gets to decide what is acceptable and unacceptable

## Your Responsibilities

It is within your responsibilities to cite the paper describing UralicNLP whenever possible. ü§© And shove money into Mika's pockets if you use UralicNLP in commercial applications.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior (like not citing me) may be
reported by contacting Mika at mika.hamalainen@helsinki.fi. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and might result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances, but mostly will result in drama and overreacting. The project team is
obligated to ~~maintain confidentiality~~ gossip with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
