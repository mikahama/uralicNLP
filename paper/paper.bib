abstract = {This paper discusses methodological strengths and shortcomings of the Constraint Grammar paradigm (CG), showing how the classical CG formalism can be extended to achieve greater expressive power and how it can be enhanced and hybridized with techniques from other parsing paradigms. We present a new, largely theory-independent CG framework and rule compiler (CG-3), that allows the linguist to write CG rules incorporating different types of linguistic information and methodology from a wide range of parsing approaches, covering not only CG’s native topological technique, but also dependency grammar, phrase structure grammar and unification grammar. In addition, we allow the integration of statistical-numerical constraints and non-discrete tag and string sets.}

abstract = {The article presents the Giellatekno & Divvun language technology resources; more specifically the effort to utilise open-source tools to improve the build infrastructure; and the solutions to help adapt to best practices for software development. The article especially discusses how the infrastructure has been remade to cope with an increasing number of languages without incurring extra overhead for the maintainers; and at the same time let the linguists concentrate on the linguistic work. Finally; the article discusses how a uniform infrastructure like the one presented can be used to easily compare languages in terms of morphological or computational complexity; coverage or for cross-lingual applications.}
